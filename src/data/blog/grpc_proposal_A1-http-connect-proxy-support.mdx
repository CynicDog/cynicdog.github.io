      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>A key point is that TCP proxies don't understand the gRPC protocol, which can break gRPC's built-in client-side load balancing. This proposal addresses how to make them work together by using HTTP CONNECT, a method that allows proxies to create a network tunnel to a specified destination. This keeps the client-side load balancing intact since the client is still directly connecting to the backend, just through a tunnel. </p>

      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>The core of the implementation is the handshaker, which is a key component in C-core for managing connections. The proxy mapper hook is the most important part of this proposal, allowing for addresses to be changed right before the connection is made. The Go and Java implementations are catching up to the C-core version, with Java using <code>java.net.ProxySelector</code> to handle proxy settings and Go using a custom dialer.</p>

      <h3>Proposed Functionality</h3>
      <p>The proposed design introduces a "proxy mapper" with two main hooks. The first hook, before name resolution, can be used to override the server name that will be resolved. The second, before connecting to a target address, can change the address that the client connects to. This gives the client a way to decide if and when a proxy is needed.</p>

      <p>This use case is for a corporate environment where all outbound traffic must go through a proxy. The gRPC client uses a proxy mapper to resolve the proxy's name instead of the original server's. This means the client only sees and connects to the proxy, which then handles all traffic. A key drawback is that this setup prevents gRPC from doing its own per-call load balancing, as the client no longer knows about the backend addresses.</p>

      <h3>Case 2</h3>
      <p>Case 2 is more flexible, where only specific destinations need a proxy. In this scenario, the proxy mapper overrides the target address, but not the name resolution. The client still resolves the backend addresses, so it can see and load balance between them. The proxy mapper simply tells the client which connections should go through the proxy tunnel, which preserves client-side per-call load balancing.</p>
    </div>

  case_3: `
    <div>
      <h3>Case 3</h3>
      <p>This is a more complex, hybrid use case. The resolver is configured to return the proxy's address but tags it with the <code>is_balancer</code> bit. This allows the gRPC client to treat the proxy as a load balancer. The proxy mapper then intercepts the addresses returned by this "balancer" and rewrites them to be the proxy's address, using the original internal address in the HTTP CONNECT request. This setup only works with the <code>grpclb</code> load balancing policy and is complex to manage since the client needs a list of all proxy addresses.</p>

  rationale: `
    <div>
      <h3>Rationale</h3>
      <p>The main reason for this design is to provide flexibility for various proxy setups. The proposal uses two different hook points, which address the needs of all three use cases. A potential issue with Case 3 is the synchronization of proxy lists across all clients. An alternative, a gRPC-level proxy, is an option but it requires the proxy to be fully trusted, which can introduce a security risk.</p>

      <h3>Open Issues</h3>
      <p>There are no major open issues. However, it's important to be careful with the configurations of both the proxy mapper and the name resolver. If they get out of sync, it could lead to unexpected runtime behavior or connection problems.</p>

* Approver: a11r
* Status: Implemented
* Implemented in: C-core (Java and Go are in progress)

## Abstract

Describes what types of TCP-level proxy setups gRPC will support and
how those setups interact with client-side per-call load balancing
policies (e.g., `grpclb` or `round_robin`).

## Background

It may be useful to read the following docs before this one:

- [gRPC load balancing](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/load-balancing.md)
- [gRPC name resolution](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md)
- [gRPC service config](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/service_config.md)

A TCP-level proxy is one that does not know anything about gRPC.
It accepts a TCP connection from a client, creates a new TCP connection
to another server, and forwards all bytes from the client to the server,
without actually understanding anything about the contents of those bytes.

Note that client-side per-call load-balancing within gRPC requires the
client to establish connections to individual backends.  Because of this,
use of a TCP-level proxy may limit the ability to do client-side per-call
load balacing in some environments.

### Related Proposals

- [gRFC A2: Service Configs in DNS](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/pull/5)
- [gRFC A5: Encoding grpclb data in DNS](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/pull/10)

## Proposal

gRPC will support TCP-level proxies via the HTTP CONNECT request,
defined in [RFC-2817](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2817).

### Use Cases

We are aware of the following use-cases for TCP-level proxying with gRPC:

1. A corp environment where all outbound traffic must go through a proxy.
   This environment has the following properties:
    - Name resolution is done by the proxy, either because external DNS
      is not resolvable internally, or because the proxy requires the
      CONNECT request to use a hostname instead of an IP address.
    - Internal traffic does not need to use the proxy, but external traffic
      does.
    - In some environments, there will not be any gRPC traffic to any internal
      servers, in which case we can unconditionally send *all* connections
      through the proxy.  This configuration is generally triggered by
      some centralized signal, such as the `http_proxy` environment variable
      or Java system properties.

2. A partially protected environment, where access to certain addresses
   must go through a proxy.  This environment has the following
   properties:
    - Name resolution of protected servers works normally, and the proxy
      allows the CONNECT request to use an IP address instead of a hostname.
    - Only requests for certain hosts must go through the proxy.
      Requests to other servers work without the proxy.
    - Custom logic is used to determine which hosts the proxy will be
      used for.

3. An environment where a service is accessible from the Internet but
   its internal architecture should not be exposed publicly.  This
   environment has the following properties:
    - Name resolution of internal names does not work externally (i.e.,
      all internal resolution must be done via the proxy).
    - Only requests for services behind the proxy will go through it.

### Proposed Functionality

We propose the following functionality to support these use cases:

- We will have some internal state (e.g., a channel arg in C-core) that
  both triggers the use of the HTTP CONNECT handshaker and specifies the
  argument to be used in the CONNECT request.

- We will support a new type of hook called a *proxy mapper*, which
  offers two points at which proxies can be selected:
    - Right before the server name is resolved, the proxy mapper can be used
      to programmatically override the name that will be resolved.  It
      will also be able to set the internal state to trigger use of the
      HTTP CONNECT handshaker.
    - Right before we connect to the target address, the proxy mapper can
      be used to programmatically override the address that we will
      connect to.  It will also be able to set the internal state to trigger
      use of the HTTP CONNECT handshaker.

### Addressing Use Cases

This new functionality will be used to address the three use-cases
described above, as follows.

#### Case 1

Case 1 will be addressed using the proxy mapper hook for overriding the
server name to resolve.  Sites that may want to send only external servers
through the proxy can implement their own proxy mapper to do this.
We will provide a default proxy mapper implementation that looks for the
existence of the `http_proxy` environment variable (or equavalent
signal).  If that signal is present, it will do the following:
- Ask the resolver to resolve the proxy name instead of the server name
  requested via the client API.  (Note that this will cause us to
  create a single subchannel to the proxy, as opposed to one
  subchannel for each backend server.)
- Add the state described above triggering the use of the HTTP CONNECT
  handshaker, with the argument set to the server name requested via
  the client API.

Note that in this case, because the client cannot know the set of server
addresses, it is impossible to use the normal gRPC client-side per-call
load balancing.  It *is* possible to do load balancing on a per-connection
basis, but that may not spread out the load evenly if different clients
impose a different amount of load.  (Note that even if we established
multiple connections to the proxy, we would have no guarantee that each
connection would go to a different backend server.)

Also, note that in this case, because the client is not resolving the
server name itself, it will not have access to the service config.

#### Case 2

This case will be addressed using the proxy mapper hook for overriding the
address to connect to.  When the proxy mapper sees an address that
should go through the proxy, it will do the following:
- Set the target address to the proxy address.
- Add the additional state described above to trigger the use of the
  HTTP CONNECT handshaker, with the argument set to the original
  target address.  Note that in this case, the server name used in
  the HTTP CONNECT request will be an IP address and port, not a
  hostname (i.e., we are not relying on the proxy to do name
  resolution for us).

In contrast to case 1, in case 2, it *is* possible to do the normal
gRPC client-side per-call load balancing, because the client does know
the set of server addresses.  The fact that the connections to those
individual addresses go through a TCP-level proxy does not interfere
with the client opening a separate subchannel to each address.

In this case, because the client is resolving the server name itself,
the client will have access to the service config as usual.

#### Case 3

This case is similar to case 1 in that the resolver cannot return
the actual addresses of the servers.  However, we (ab)use the gRPC
load-balancing design to work around this, so that it looks more like
case 2.

In this case, the resolver must return the address of the proxy, but
with the `is_balancer` bit set.  This can be done either by writing a
custom resolver or by publishing a DNS SRV record for the server name's
`grpclb` service that points to the proxy name (as per [gRFC A5: Encoding
grpclb data in DNS](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/pull/10)).

Next, we use the proxy mapper hook for overriding the address to
connect to.  The proxy mapper implementation will have to detect two
types of addresses:
- When it sees the proxy address, it will set the HTTP CONNECT argument to
  the original server name (which will cause the proxy to establish a
  connection to one of the load balancers).
- When it sees any internal address (i.e., the addresses returned by
  the load balancer), it will replace it with the proxy address and set
  the HTTP CONNECT argument to the internal address.

Note that this will work only if the `grpclb` load balancing policy is
in use; it will not work with client-side policies like `round_robin`.

Also, note that if a custom resolver is implemented, then the client
may not have access to the service config.  However, if the DNS SRV
record is published, then the service config will be returned normally.

## Rationale

The proposed design allows two different ways of triggering use of
the HTTP CONNECT handshaker code, which addresses the needs of the
use-cases described above.

There is one down-side to the approach for case 3, which is that the proxy
mapper and the name resolver both have to agree on the list of known
proxy addresses.  So, for example, if the proxy mapper implementation
is getting the list of proxy addresses from a local file, the service
owner would need to first push an updated list that contains the new
proxy address to all clients.  Then, once all clients have been updated,
the new proxy can be added to DNS.

Note that another alternative for case 3 would be to use a gRPC-level
proxy instead of a TCP-level proxy, where the proxy natively speaks gRPC.
The idea is that the proxy accepts a gRPC request from the external client
and then uses its own client on the internal side, which does the name
resolution and per-call load balancing internally to the backend servers.
The trade-off here is that this approach requires that the gRPC-level
proxy be trusted by all internal servers, which has security implications
(e.g., a successful attack on the proxy would yield priviledged access
on all internal servers).

## Implementation

In C-core, the HTTP CONNECT handshaker was already implemented.
The following additional changes have also been made:

- [grpc/grpc#9383](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/9383) (changes
  HTTP CONNECT handshaker to be triggered via channel args)
- [grpc/grpc#9372](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/9372) (adds proxy
  mapper hook for address rewriting)
- [grpc/grpc#9557](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/9557) (adds proxy
  mapper hook for name rewriting)

In Go, this functionality is being provided via a custom dialer:

- [grpc/grpc-go#1098](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/pull/1098)

In Java for case 1, Java's `java.net.ProxySelector` is observed and usable
starting in v1.11.0. `ProxySelector` is generally configured with the Java
properties `-Dhttps.proxyHost` and related. grpc-java supports HTTP Basic Proxy
Authentication and credentials can be specified via the default
`java.net.Authenticator`. The experimental `GRPC_PROXY_EXP=host:port`
environment variable enabled limited proxy support starting in v1.0.3.
