Suppose we’re building a solution that helps users transform raw data to be used in the cloud. Some teams start with the UI. Others dive into database schemas and ER diagrams. Some begin with WBS charts or R&R matrices in spreadsheets.

But I’ve often felt that none of these really cut to the core. In reality, the first thing we should be identifying is the domain — the actual entities and flows in the business process. Especially in projects where the goals are still foggy — even to the customers themselves — the real challenge is shaping vague needs into concrete actions.

And that’s where visualizing the domain helps.
